# HireOps API Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

The HireOps API is now fully functional with comprehensive CRUD operations, authentication, and audit trails.

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### API Documentation
- **Interactive Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## üîê Authentication Flow

### 1. Register a User (Admin/Initial Setup)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "email": "admin@hireops.com",
    "password": "adminpassword123",
    "full_name": "System Administrator",
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

### 2. Login to Get Token
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=adminpassword123"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### 3. Use Token for Authenticated Requests
Add the token to subsequent requests:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/jobs/"
```
