This is a very well-documented problem statement — thanks for sharing it clearly. Here's a complete system design + development plan using Python and any suitable DB. I'll also highlight the P1 issue, and design a feasible backend-first solution that can later be integrated with a frontend.

🔧 Objective
Build a centralized portal to replace fragmented Google Sheets operations. It should:
	• Capture requirements & candidate data
	• Track status changes with historical logs
	• Manage user-based dashboards & permissions
	• Be easy to scale, search, and filter
	• Be built entirely with Python-based tech stack

🔍 P1 Priority Issue to Solve
	Track full status change history per candidate, including:
	• What status changed (e.g., from “Submitted” → “L1 Scheduled”)
	• Who changed it
	• On what date

🏗️ System Design
🔹 1. Tech Stack
Layer	Tech
Backend	Python + FastAPI
Database	MySQLQL (or MongoDB if you prefer NoSQL)
Frontend (Later)	HTML + Jinja2 or React (Optional, or can use Streamlit temporarily)
ORM	SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM
Auth	FastAPI JWT Auth
API Docs	Swagger (comes with FastAPI)
Optional	Docker, Git, Heroku/Fly.io for deployment

🔹 2. Key Entities
✅ User Table
user_id (PK)
username
email
password_hash
role (business_head, am, recruiter, sales)
✅ Requirement Table
req_id (PK, auto-increment)
req_name
req_create_date
ageing (calculated)
no_of_positions
client_name
client_id
client_spoc
end_customer
account
mode_of_employment
recruiter_id (FK)
am_id (FK)
status
notes
priority
location
budget
experience
✅ Candidate Table
candidate_id (PK, auto-increment)
req_id (FK to Requirement)
candidate_name
mobile
email
profile_submission_date
current_status
date_of_status_update
verified_by_am (bool)
remarks
mode_of_employment (redundant copy)
✅ Candidate Status History Table (solves P1)
history_id (PK)
candidate_id (FK)
changed_by_user_id (FK)
old_status
new_status
change_date
remarks

🧱 Data Flow
	1. Sales team adds a requirement → stored in Requirement
	2. AM assigns recruiter → updates recruiter_id in the record
	3. Recruiter submits candidates → stored in Candidate
	4. When status is changed:
		○ Update Candidate.current_status
		○ Also insert a record into CandidateStatusHistory

🔐 Access Control (RBAC)
Role	Permissions
Business Head	Full access
AM	View/edit assigned requirements and candidates
Recruiter	View/edit only their candidates
Sales	Read-only
Use FastAPI’s dependency injection to enforce this in route-level.

📊 Dashboards (Future)
Design using filters:
	• Requirement Dashboard: filter by client, status, recruiter, ageing
	• Candidate Dashboard: filter by status, recruiter, AM, submission date
	• Status History Tracker: show full change history per candidate

🧪 Optional: Audit Trail + Notifications
	• Add a logs table to capture changes across the system
	• Send email/Slack/Telegram alerts when status changes (if needed)

✅ Development Plan
Phase 1: Setup Project
	• Setup FastAPI + MySQLQL using SQLAlchemy
	• Create basic models, tables & relationships
	• Create sample APIs for:
		○ Adding requirements
		○ Adding candidates
		○ Updating candidate status with audit log
Phase 2: Authentication & Role Access
	• User registration/login (JWT-based)
	• Middleware to restrict based on user role
Phase 3: Dashboards + Filtering
	• Requirement View (based on filters)
	• Candidate View (filterable by status, AM, etc.)
	• Candidate history view
Phase 4: Web Interface (Optional)
	• Use Jinja2, React, or Streamlit to create basic UI
	• Connect frontend to API

🤔 Questions to Clarify with Client
	1. Does each recruiter belong to only one AM?
	2. Can multiple recruiters work on a single requirement?
	3. Do candidates go through only one status at a time, or can multiple interviews (L1 + L2) happen in parallel?
	4. Does client need any kind of document uploads? (e.g. resumes)
	5. Is candidate info confidential or internal? Any need for encryption?
	6. How are users authenticated right now? Can we create their logins fresh?

🧠 Tips to Start
	• Start with a clean FastAPI project using uvicorn + SQLAlchemy
	• Build core models first, test them in isolation (e.g. User, Requirement, Candidate)
	• Build a single flow: add requirement → add candidate → change status + history log
	• Only once the flow is perfect, think of frontend
	• Use Postman to test the APIs initially

Would you like me to scaffold this project for you? I can generate:
	• Folder structure
	• Sample models.py
	• API routes
	• .env + database connection boilerplate
Let me know — we can take this from design to working MVP fast.

Perfect — we’ll take it step-by-step, assuming no prior FastAPI project experience. I’ll walk you through the entire backend setup, starting from zero.

✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Your Project in Python (Backend Only)

🧱 1. Prerequisites
✅ You only need:
	• Python 3.10 or above
	• VSCode or any editor
	• Basic terminal knowledge

📁 2. Project Folder Structure
Create a folder named recruitment_portal like this:
recruitment_portal/
│
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              ← FastAPI entry point
│   ├── models.py            ← SQLAlchemy models (DB tables)
│   ├── schemas.py           ← Pydantic models (for request/response validation)
│   ├── database.py          ← DB connection & setup
│   ├── crud.py              ← Functions to interact with DB
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── user.py          ← Routes for user login/signup
│   │   └── candidate.py     ← Routes for candidate flow
│   └── auth.py              ← JWT auth logic
│
├── .env                     ← Stores DB credentials
├── requirements.txt         ← Python dependencies
└── README.md


⚙️ 3. Initial Setup
mkdir recruitment_portal
cd recruitment_portal
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
Create requirements.txt:
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
psycopg2-binary
python-dotenv

🔗 4. Database Setup (MySQLQL recommended)
Install MySQLQL and create a DB:
CREATE DATABASE recruitment_db;
Or, for now, just use SQLite for simplicity.

🧠 5. database.py – Connect to DB
# app/database.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, declarative_base
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")  # from .env
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine, autocommit=False, autoflush=False)
Base = declarative_base()
Your .env file:
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./recruitment.db
# or for MySQL: MySQLql://user:password@localhost:5432/recruitment_db

📦 6. models.py – Sample Table: User & CandidateStatusHistory
# app/models.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from .database import Base
import datetime
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    username = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)
    role = Column(String)
    password = Column(String)
class CandidateStatusHistory(Base):
    __tablename__ = "status_history"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    candidate_id = Column(Integer)
    old_status = Column(String)
    new_status = Column(String)
    changed_by_user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
changed_by = relationship("User")

🔄 7. main.py – FastAPI App
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from .database import Base, engine
from app.routes import user, candidate
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(user.router)
app.include_router(candidate.router)

📬 8. Example Route (e.g. candidate.py)
# app/routes/candidate.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter(
    prefix="/candidate",
    tags=["Candidates"]
)
@router.get("/status")
def get_status():
    return {"message": "All candidate statuses will come here"}

🚀 9. Run the App
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Now go to: http://localhost:8000/docs — FastAPI gives automatic Swagger UI.

🪜 What Next?
Here’s the learning staircase we’ll climb:
	1. ✅ Setup (done above)
	2. 🔐 User login/signup with JWT
	3. 📋 CRUD operations for:
		○ Requirements
		○ Candidates
		○ Status updates with logging
	4. 📊 Dashboard APIs (filter by status, recruiter, etc.)
	5. 🧑‍💻 Admin role permissions
	6. (Optional) 🖼️ Web frontend (can use Streamlit or Jinja)

🙋 Ask Me This Now
Before moving forward, clarify this with your client:
	1. Will users manually log in or should we pre-create their accounts?
	2. Should the platform allow resume uploads?
	3. Are clients (A, B, C) going to use the platform too, or only internal staff?

If you're okay with this plan, I’ll now create the boilerplate code and share the complete working template for you to try locally.
Do you want that now?
